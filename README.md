# Spell-Corrector

Program that can correct the wrong Spelled Words and provide the best possible alternative based on the different combinations probablity.


It's a java code which checks for spelling errors in a file or sentence and can provide the most possible correct word that user might be tryng to write.


This project can be usefull for other spell correction projects. It works depending upon the learning set you provide.It needs a data set with all the autheticated correct spelled words like an article from english newspaper or a novel whose words speeling can be trusted. The larger and better the data set, the better spell correction will be.


I have provided the algorithm I have used for spelling correction which can be used to develop further. Though I have implemented most of it but you can still try to make it work better . Please refer "Shubham-spell-corrector-source.pdf" file that I have provided


Knowledge base or sample data is stored in text file under project. I have not spent much time on this code ...so free to make changes and make it better   
:D
